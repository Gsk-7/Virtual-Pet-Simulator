# üêæ Pet Paws - Virtual Pet Simulator

This is an interactive web application that simulates the experience of taking care of a virtual pet. You can choose a pet, name it, and then care for it by feeding, playing, and letting it rest.

This project was built using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, as per the project requirements.

## Features

- **Component-Based Vanilla JS:** The application is architected with a state management system and render functions, mimicking a modern framework without using one.
- **Dynamic State-driven Animations:** All pets are rendered as SVGs and have unique animations for different moods (happy, sad, eating, playing) and an idle "breathing" state.
- **Realistic Pet Behavior:** Pets will visually and textually communicate their needs (hunger, loneliness, tiredness). Actions are disabled when a pet is too tired or full.
- **Day/Night Cycle:** The background and ambient lighting change dynamically from day to night to create an immersive world.
- **Achievements:** The game tracks user interactions and rewards players with achievements.
- **Engaging UI:** All screens and interactions from the prototype have been preserved.
